#summary Explains how to use depend tool.

= Introduction =

Depend application is the first step in your code analysis. It parses all your C++ code base, identifying dependencies between internal (yours) and external modules.

Depend's main goal is to produce an XML file containing the code analysis result. The other tools in the suite uses this XML to compute their own analysis.

But depend can also be used to detect include errors like case sensitive includes, "" vs <> includes, etc...
