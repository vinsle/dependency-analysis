#summary Explains how to use depend_graph.

= Introduction =

*Depend Graph* is a tool made for graph generation using [http://www.graphviz.org GraphViz]. Each module is represented as a node. An edge represents a module dependency to another module. Three metrics are drawn:
 * *I* for Instability
 * *A* for Abstractness
 * *D* for Distance (see UnderstandingMetrics for more informations)
Node coloration depends on distance value, from <font color='red'>*Red*</font> with D = 100 through <font color='orange'>*Orange*</font> with D = 50, to <font color='green'>*Green*</font> with D = 0 (_the bigger the Distance, the poorer the design_).

All strongly connected components (or [UsingDependComponents circular dependencies]) are represented with same colored edges.

Default Graphviz layout can be totally overridden using proper command line parameters (*layout*, *graph*, *node*, *edge*).



<font color='red'>*Important*</font>: GraphViz <font color='red'>*must*</font> be installed before using *Depend Graph*.
